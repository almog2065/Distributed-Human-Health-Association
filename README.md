# Distributed-Human-Health-Association

The project's goal is to assist the "Distributed Human Health Association" in improving people's health by analyzing data. The data consists of motion sensor readings recorded during various activities. The project is divided into three main parts:  Data Analysis ,Learning Task Extract and Learn.

Let's delve into each part and its corresponding files:

## Part 1: Data Analysis
In this section, you'll analyze the data to derive insights. The insights should cover different aspects, such as time and space dimensions. You'll also use visualizations to present your findings.

### Files:
- project2_part1.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing your analysis and explanations using Markdown cells.
- project2_part1.html: HTML version of the notebook for easy viewing.

## Part 2: Learning Task
For this part, you'll build a Machine Learning model to predict the activity variable ('gt') based on insights from Part 1. The model should achieve a minimum of 40% accuracy when training on 70% of the data and testing on 30% of the data.

### Files:
- project2_part2.pdf: PDF file containing a description of your learning task, including the model description and evaluation details.
- project2_part2.py: Python file containing your model implementation using Spark MLlib.

## Part 3: Extract and Learn
In this dynamic data processing part, you'll use Spark Streaming to extract data from the source while training and testing the ML model built in Part 2. Your goal is to show the model's performance throughout the streaming process.

### Files:
project2_part3.py: Python file containing the process of extracting data, training the model, and testing it using Spark Streaming.
project2_part3.pdf: PDF file detailing your training process, model accuracy, and insights gained from the streaming process.
